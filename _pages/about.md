I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Robotics at the Université de Sherbrooke (UdeS), where my research is centered around the application of learning-based methods for painting robots, specifically emphasizing adaptive robot control for learning and reproduction of artwork. Under the expert guidance of François Ferland, I am leading a collaborative project with Acrylic Robotics company, contributing to advancements in robotic applications. In addition to my Ph.D. pursuits, I host a podcast in the Persian language, covering topics within the realms of Robotics and AI.
