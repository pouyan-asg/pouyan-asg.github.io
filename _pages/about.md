This is my personal blog. I mainly make blog posts that explain ideas that are interesting to me. Many of these ideas happen to be in the realm of current machine learning progress, but they are not limited to this. Please contact me if you have anything that you think is worth covering, I am always open to thinking about new perspectives!

I am a rising senior at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/) pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science concurrently with a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics-Computer Science. I am interested in (1) solving complex engineering problems and (2) exploring fascinating mathematic/scientific ideas. My goal is to build algorithms that learn how to do useful things and are aligned with human values. This past summer, I interned at [Point72](https://point72.com/) in the Market Intelligence, Proprietary Research division for data science. I also do research in the [LUNAR Lab](https://lunar.cs.brown.edu/) focused on investigating compositionality using causal interventions methods, mechanistic interpretability, and reinforcement learning from human feedback with Dr. Ellie Pavlick.
